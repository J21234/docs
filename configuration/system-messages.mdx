## Commands

There are three system message commands, each with the same subcommands.

- `welcome` - Dispatched whenever a user joins the server.
- `goodbye` - Dispatched whenever a user leaves the server.
- `boost` - Dispatched whenever a user boosts the server.

## Subcommands

The following examples use the `welcome` command, but the same syntax is applied for the other system message commands.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Creating a system message">
        Use the `welcome add` subcommand to create a system message.
        <Tip>
        The `message` parameter can be raw text or an [embed](/resources/scripting) with dynamic [variables](/resources/variables).
        </Tip>
        <Info>
        The `--delete_after` flag in system messages schedules the message for
        deletion after a specified time, which must be between `6` and `60` seconds.
        </Info>
        <CodeGroup>

        ```javascript Syntax
        ,welcome add (channel) (message) [--delete_after [6-60]]
        ```

        ```javascript Example
        ,welcome add #joneral welcome to {guild} {user.mention} --delete_after 30
        ,welcome add #joneral {message: {user.mention}}$v{embed}$v{description: welcome to {guild.name}}
        ```

        </CodeGroup>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Viewing a system message">
        Use the `welcome view` subcommand to dispatch a system message.
        <CodeGroup>

        ```javascript Syntax
        ;welcome view <channel>
        ```

        ```javascript Example
        ;welcome view #joneral
        ```

        </CodeGroup>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Removing a system message">
        Use the `welcome remove` subcommand to remove a system message.
        <CodeGroup>

        ```javascript Syntax
        ;welcome remove <channel>
        ```

        ```javascript Example
        ;welcome remove #general
        ```

        </CodeGroup>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Viewing all system messages">
        Use the `welcome list` subcommand to view all system messages.
    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>
<Tip>
  The `boost` event is only dispatched if the server has the **Discord System
  Message** enabled or whenever the user receives the **Server Booster** role
  which only occurs once.
