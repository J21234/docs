## Overview

Moderation commands require some basic setup before they can be used. This includes **moderation logs**, **mute roles**, and the **jailed role & channel**.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Creating the case logs & jail role">
        <Info>
            Jail is a feature similar to mute, but it restricts the user's access to all channels except the jail channel.
        </Info>

        Use the `,setup` command to create the case logs channel and jail role.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Creating the necessary mute roles">
        <Info>
            This will create a **text mute**, **image mute**, and **reaction mute** role.
        </Info>
        Use the `,setupmute` command to create the necessary mute roles.
    </Step>

</Steps>

Upon completion of the setup, you'll notice a few new roles and channels in your server.

- **Muted** - Used to restrict users from sending messages.
- **Image Muted** - Used to restrict users from uploading attachments.
- **Reaction Muted** - Used to restrict users from reacting to messages.
- **Jailed** - Used to restrict users from all channels except the `#jail` channel.

<Info>
  The `#jail-log` channel logs all moderation actions done through bleed (e.g.
  `,ban` & `,kick`). The `#jail` channel is where users jailed by the `jail`
  command are restricted to.
</Info>

## Invoke Messages

You can customize the response for moderation commands which is by default `üëç` and the direct message which will be sent after punishing the user.

The following moderation commands can be customized:

- `jail`, `kick`, `ban`, `tempban`, `softban`, `hardban`, `timeout` & `warn`.

<Tip>
The `message` parameter can be raw text or an [embed](/resources/scripting) with dynamic [variables](/resources/variables).
