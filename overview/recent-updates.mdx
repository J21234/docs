### VoiceMaster Structure Changes

Subcommands for `voicemaster default` have been restructured to make it easier to use.

- `voicemaster defaultregion` -> `voicemaster default region`
- `voicemaster defaultbitrate` -> `voicemaster default bitrate`

A new subcommand `voicemaster default name` has been added as well.
This automatically sets the name of the **VoiceMaster channel** to a pre-configured name which is dynamic.
