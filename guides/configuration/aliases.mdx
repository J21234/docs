## Creating aliases

Creating an alias is very simple! All you need to do is run the `alias add [shortcut] [command]` command.

Below is an example of `boot` being made as an alias for `kick`.

When the `boot` alias is invoked, it will run the normal `kick` command.

## Arguments in Aliases

Arguments might seem complicated at first, but they're very simple once you figure out how they work!

Arguments start from `0`. The first argument in a command is the word after the command name. For example:

```
// The first argument here is "jonathan"
ban jonathan Harassing members
```

To represent an argument in an alias, put the **argument number** in curly brackets.

Below is an example of creating an alias with arguments.

```
alias add shh timeout {0} 10m
```

Looking at the `timeout` command syntax, you can see it's `timeout [member] [duration] [reason]`.
Replacing the `[member]` parameter in our alias with `{0}` will make bleed timeout the first argument in our alias for 10 minutes.

When running the `shh` command with a member mention as the **first argument**, bleed will timeout the member for 10 minutes.

### Image Permissions

<Info>
    Bleed doesn't add **image permissions** to a role, it only adds the role to a member.
    <br/>Make sure you give the role image permissions if you want to set this up.
</Info>

One of the most popular uses for aliases is adding image permissions to a member with the simple `pic` command, so let's set that up!

Run the command `alias add pic role {0} [image permissions role]`.

<Frame type="glass" caption="Adding an alias for granting the image permissions role and using it">

</Frame>

Whenever you run the `pic [member]` command, bleed will apply your image permissions role to that member, granting them permissions to upload media.

You aren't limited to just the first argument in aliases, you can use as many arguments as you want!
A smart way for finding the argument number is choosing which argument you want, for example, the third argument, then subtracting one from that number. 
The argument number for the third argument would be `2`.
