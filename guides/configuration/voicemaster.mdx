## Initial Setup
<Steps>
  <Step title="Initalization">
    The first step to setting up VoiceMaster is to run the `vm setup` command.

    ```
    voicemaster setup
    ```
    
    This command will create a new category with two new channels, an `interface` text channel, which contains VC controls for users, and a `Join to Create` voice channel, which is used to create temporary VCs upon joining. 
    </Step>
  </Steps>

## Customization
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="voicemaster category">
        Set the category where all new voicemaster channels will be created.
        ```
        voicemaster category <category name_or_id>
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="voicemaster default bitrate">
        Set the default bitrate of all new voicemaster channels. The default is `64`.
        ```
        voicemaster default bitrate <8-384>
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="voicemaster default role">
        Set the default role to be assigned to members who join **any** voicemaster channel. This role will be removed upon them leaving the VC.

        ```
        voicemaster default role @role
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="voicemaster default name">
        Set the default name of all new voicemaster channels.

        This supports [variables!](/extras/variables)
        ```
        Example:
        voicemaster default name {user.name}'s crib
        ```
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="voicemaster reset">
        Completely remove the voicemaster integration from your server.
        ```
        voicemaster reset
        ```
        <Warning>
            This will delete all channels and categories created by voicemaster. This includes `interface`, `Join to Create`, and the entire voicemaster category. 
        </Warning>
