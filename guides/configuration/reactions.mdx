title: 'Reaction Triggers'
description: 'Reaction triggers let bleed react to messages when specific conditions, like containing a certain word, are met.'
---

## Setup

You can add reaction triggers with `reactiontrigger add`, or `rt add` for simplicity. 

<Info>
  Note that reaction triggers have to be a minimum of 3 characters, and certain common words like `hi` and `hey` are not allowed to prevent spamming the bot and slowing it down.

## Reaction Messages
You can also set up bleed so every message sent in a channel with will be have up to 3 reactions added with `reaction messages`. 
The channel must be an `imgonly` channel or have a slowmode of at least **one minute** to prevent spam.
