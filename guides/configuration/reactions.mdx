## Reaction triggers

You can add reaction triggers with the `reactiontrigger add` command - or `rt add` for simplicity. 

<Info>
  Note that reaction triggers have to be a minimum of 3 characters, and certain common words like `hi` and `hey` are not allowed to prevent spamming the bot and slowing it down.

## Reaction messages
You can also setup bleed so every message sent in a channel with will be have up to 3 reactions added with `reaction messages`. 
The channel must be an `imgonly` channel or have a slowmode of at least **one minute** to prevent spam.
