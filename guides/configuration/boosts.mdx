### Information
You can add or remove a boost message in a channel with **embed code** or **raw text**, and you can use all supported [variables](/extras/variables). For help making an embed, see our [scripting guide](/guides/embed/scripting) or join our [Embed Server](https://discord.gg/embeds) for premade embeds to use.

  This command accepts the `--self_destruct 6` parameter, which makes the message autodelete after 6 seconds. You can add a higher number to make it stay in the channel longer, but 6 seconds is the minimum.
