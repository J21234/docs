## About
To use this feature, you need to invite bleed's dedicated **Vanity Bot**. It is available to all users who have purchased bleed, and can be invited [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=996638412675227668&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands).

<Warning>
  Your server must be **Level 3** (14 boosts) prior to inviting the bot.
</Warning>

## Setup Commands
Once the vanity bot has been invited, you can begin the setup. Please note the vanity bot uses **slash commands**.
