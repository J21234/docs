## About
To use this feature, you need to invite Bleed's dedicated **Vanity Bot**. It is available to all users who have purchased bleed, and can be invited [here.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=996638412675227668&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

<Warning>
  Your server must be **level 3** (14 boosts), otherwise the vanity bot will leave!
</Warning>

## Setup Commands
Once the vanity bot has been invited, you can begin the setup. Please note the vanity bot uses **slash commands**.

| Commands | Usage |
| -----------------| ----- |
| `/vanity set` | Sets the vanity that bleed will watch for
| `/vanity role add` | Sets what role to give when the vanity is being used
| `/vanity role remove` | Removes the current role to give
| `/vanity role list` | Lists award roles
| `/vanity award channel` | Sets the channel where bleed sends the vanity message
| `/vanity message` | Sets the thank you message
| `/vanity log channel` | Sets the logging channel for add/removal of vanity

## FAQ
1. Why are there two seperate bots?
> To save resources on the main bot, and due to some Discord limitations regarding privileged intents.
2. Does the vanity bot cost extra money?
> No, it's available to all users who have bleed and 14 boosts.
3. Why is the vanity bot spamming my log channel?
> Due to how Discord works, when a user goes offline their status is removed, and when they go online it is returned. If you have a user going online and offline a lot this can cause lots of logs.
4. Can I use prefix commands?
> No, the vanity bot uses slash commands only.
5. How do I know I'm inviting the real vanity bot?
> The bot's username is `bleed vanity#2079`.
