## Setup
<Steps>
  <Step title="Unlock levelling (required)">
    The level system has to be unlocked before XP will be given to members.
    ```
    ,levels unlock
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure level roles">
    Level roles can be added to give users rewards for reaching a certain level. 
    ```
    ,levels add rolename rank
    ```
    ```
    ,levels add @level 5 5
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your level message">
    The level message is what users see when they acheive a new rank. You can set the way that users receive the level message with the command below.
    ```
    ,levels messagemode context
    ```
    There are 4 options you can use for this command:

    - `pm` - sends the message to the users DMs.
    - `context` - sends the message to the channel the user was chatting in when they leveled up.
    - `#channelmention` - sends all messages to the mentioned channel
    - `none` - disables level messages
    
    You can then customise the content of the message with the command below.
    ```
    ,levels message Congrats {user} on the level up!
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blacklist roles and channels">
    Roles and channels can be blacklisted as per your server needs. 
    ```
    ,levels ignore #spam
    ```
    ```
    ,levels ignore @jailed
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
