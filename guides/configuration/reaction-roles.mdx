## Setup

The `reactionrole add` command is the all-in-one setup command for enabling a reaction role.

<Info>
  {" "}
  The command requires a pre-sent message to attach the reactions to, which can either
  be raw text or an embed. For help creating an embed, refer to the embeds section
  of this documentation.
</Info>{" "}

The syntax for adding a reaction role is as follows:

```
reactionrole add [message link] [reaction] [role]
```

```
reactionrole add https://discord.com/channels... :tick: @member
```
