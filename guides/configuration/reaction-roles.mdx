title: 'Reaction Roles'
description: 'Reaction roles allow bleed to automatically assign a role when a reaction is used. This can be used for verification, or roles like custom age / gender roles.'

## Setup
The `reactionrole add` command is the all in one setup command for enabling a reaction role. 

For this command, you will require a pre-sent message to attach the reactions to - this can be raw text or an embed. For help creating an embed, refer to the embeds section of this documentation. 

The syntax for adding a reactionrole is as follows:
```
reactionrole add [message link] [reaction] [role]
```
```
reactionrole add https://discord.com/channels... :tick: @member
```
