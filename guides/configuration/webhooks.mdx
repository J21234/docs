## What are webhooks?
Webhooks can be created with bleed, Webhooks are a low-effort way to post messages to channels in Discord with a custom name and avatar. 
<Info>Webhooks can be sent with embed code by using `{embed}` in the message section. For help with this, join the [embed](https://discord.gg/embeds) support server.</Info>

<Step title= "Create your webhook">
When creating a webhook with bleed, run the following command: `,webhook create (name of your webhook)`. You can change this name later within discord channel settings under "Integrations".
