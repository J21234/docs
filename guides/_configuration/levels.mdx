## Setup
<Steps>
  <Step title="Unlock levelling (required)">
    The level system has to be unlocked before XP will be given to members.
    ```
    levels unlock
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure level roles">
    Level roles can be added to give users rewards for reaching a certain level. 
    ```
    levels add rolename rank
    ```
    ```
    levels add @level 5 5
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your level message">
    The level message is what users see when they achieve a new rank and the type of message can be configured using the command below.
    ```
    levels messagemode (option)
    ```
    There are 4 options you can use for this command:
    - `pm` - sends the message to the users DMs.
    - `context` - sends the message to the channel the user was chatting in when they leveled up.
    - `#channelmention` - sends all messages to the mentioned channel.
    - `none` - disables level messages.
    
    You can then customize the content of the message with the command below.
    ```
    levels message Congrats {user} on the level up!
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Blacklist roles and channels">
    Roles and channels can be blacklisted as per the needs of your server. 
    ```
    levels ignore #spam
    ```
    ```
    levels ignore @jailed
    ```
  </Step>
