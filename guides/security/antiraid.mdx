title: 'Antiraid'
description: 'Antiraid prevents the joining of malicious automated accounts into your server and consists of three modules detailed below.'
---

## Antiraid Massjoin
Antiraid Massjoin triggers when five (or more, depending on your threshold) members join a server within 1.61 seconds. From then on, all suspected raid accounts will be punished with the punishment you have set.

This command takes both the ``--threshold`` parameter, to define how many accounts it takes to trigger the antiraid, and the ``--do`` parameter to determine the punishment.
### Example:
```
antiraid massjoin on
antiraid massjoin on --threshold 4
antiraid massjoin on --threshold 4 --do kick
```
## Antiraid Defaultpfp
This module punishes users that have Discord's default profile picture. This is useful as a lot of automated raid accounts do not have a unique profile picture set. 

This command only takes the `--do` parameter for the punishment.
### Example:
```
antiraid defaultpfp on
antiraid defaultpfp on --do kick
```
## Antiraid Newaccounts
This module punishes users that have a new Discord account. A lot of raid accounts are freshly created, and therefore, this is an effective way to stop them.  

This command takes both the ``--threshold`` parameter, to define how many days young the account has to be to trigger, and the ``--do`` parameter to determine the punishment.
### Example:
```
antiraid newaccounts on
antiraid newaccounts on --threshold 4
antiraid newaccounts on --threshold 4 --do kick
```

## I've been raided, what now?
- **If you didn't have bleed's protections enabled**, make sure to enable them. You can remove the raid accounts from your server with the `raid` command.
```
//Syntax
raid (time) (kick or ban) (reason)

// Example 
raid 5m ban Suspected raid
```

- **If you did have protections enabled**, congratulations! Your server is safe. Once you have verified that the raid is over, run `antiraid raidstate off` to remove bleed's raid state.
